This repository provides CTL transforms with predefined parameter sets that
invoke functions from [aces-core](github.com/ampas/aces-core) to produce reference
output renders for standard and commonly used display configurations. 

These presets are provided as a recommendation of which transforms to make
available in tools. However, users are not restricted to the included transforms
and may define additional output transforms for other display characteristics as
needed.

The [ACES documentation](docs.acescentral.com) explains the available Output
Transform parameters and their intended usage.
