## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you thank you have discovered a potential vulnerability, please report it using GitHub’s built-in [Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing) feature. This ensures the report remains private until it is reviewed by maintainers and an appropriate fix is in place.

1. Go to this repository’s **"Security"** tab.
2. Select **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3. Provide as much detail as possible so we can investigate and address the issue promptly.

Please do not disclose any details of the issue publicly until we have had a chance to investigate and provide a fix. This helps keep the project and its users safe.
