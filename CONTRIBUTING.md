# Contributing to ACES

## Legal Requirements

ACES is a project hosted by the Academy Software Foundation (ASWF) and follows
the open source software best practice policies of the ASWF TAC with guidance
from the Linux Foundation.

### License

ACES is licensed under the [Apache 2.0](./LICENSE) license. New contributions
should abide by that license. 

### Contributor License Agreements

To maintain the legal integrity of the project's codebase, we require all
contributors to complete a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**.

ACES uses [EasyCLA](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/easycla) for managing
CLAs, which automatically checks to ensure CLAs are signed by a contributor
before a commit can be merged.

* If you are an individual writing the code on your own time and you're SURE you
  are the sole owner of any intellectual property you contribute, you can [sign
  the CLA as an individual
  contributor](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/contributors/individual-contributor).

* If you are writing the code as part of your job, or if there is any
  possibility that your employers might think they own any intellectual property
  you create, then you should use the [Corporate Contributor Licence
  Agreement](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/contributors/corporate-contributor).

The ACES CLA's are the standard forms used by Linux Foundation projects and
[recommended by the ASWF
TAC](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/blob/main/process/contributing.md#contributor-license-agreement-cla).

### Commit Sign-Off

Every commit must be signed off. That is, every commit log message must include
a “`Signed-off-by`” line (generated, for example, with “`git commit --signoff`”
or "`git commit -s`"), indicating that the committer wrote the code and has the
right to release it under the [license](LICENSE).

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter
accepts the DCO:

`Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>`

If John Doe has signed an individual CLA, or his corporation's CLA Manager has
included his GitHub account in a corporate CLA approved list, his pull request
can be merged. Otherwise the EasyCLA system will provide instructions on signing
a CLA, or request inclusion in an existing corporate CLA approved list.

See the [ASWF TAC
CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/blob/main/process/contributing.md#contribution-sign-off)
file for more information on this requirement.
